        <p>Fruits are an excellent source of essential vitamins and minerals, 
            and they are high in fiber. Fruits also provide a wide range of 
            health-boosting antioxidants, including flavonoids. Eating a diet high
            in fruits and vegetables can reduce a person's risk of developing heart
            disease, cancer, inflammation, and diabetes.
